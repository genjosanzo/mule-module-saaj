# This file is the service descriptor for your transport
# It ties all the implementation classes together so that Mule can
# construct endpoints for your transport protocol at runtime
# For a full list of properties that can be set here see -
# http://mule.mulesource.org/x/FwKV

# The connector class for your transport. This is alwas required
connector=org.mule.transport.saaj.SaajConnector

# The message adapter is used as the Mule internal representation of a message received or sent by 
# your transport. This is always required.
message.adapter=org.mule.transport.saaj.SaajMessageAdapter

# The factory used to create dispatchers responsible for sending events from the underlying technology
dispatcher.factory=org.mule.transport.saaj.SaajMessageDispatcherFactory

# The standard message receiver used to consume events from the underlying technology
message.receiver=org.mule.transport.saaj.SaajMessageReceiver

#The standard message requester used to request data from the underlying technology
requester.factory=org.mule.transport.saaj.SaajMessageRequesterFactory



# Defines the way in which endpoints for your transport will be constructed
# Options are (but you can write your own) -
#     org.mule.endpoint.ResourceEndpointBuilder i.e. vm://my.queue
#     org.mule.endpoint.UrlEndpointBuilder i.e. axis:http://localhost:1234/context/Service?params
#     org.mule.endpoint.SocketEndpointBuilder i.e. udp://localhost:2222

#endpoint.builder=org.mule.endpoint.UrlEndpointURIBuilder
